# Mimic Master

A game using spectral fingerprints/voice biometrics and/or general speech analysis techniques to compare target sounds and mimicked sounds. For reference, <a href="https://a-n-rose.github.io/2018/08/24/mimic-master-pitchcurve-vs-fingerprint.html">here</a> is my blogpost on the first version of this game, and <a href="https://a-n-rose.github.io/2018/08/29/comparing-prosody.html">here</a> is my blogpost on improving measurement settings/calculations.

## Getting Started
